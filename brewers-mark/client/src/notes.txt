Four main categories suggested: (eliminate Ale because all beers either lager or an ale):
    -IPA
    -Sours
    -Lagers
    -Stouts

***New England IPA is most popular right now- need to include***

***USE BJCP Phone app- breaks all beers down to taste/flavor and in depth info on all categories***

***What type of beer do you normally like?*** (Might be worth asking twice in a different way (people don’t seem to tell correctly the first time)

Use Untappd- most checked in are national beers, and they give suggestions of other beers you also might like on Untappd

IPA- Categories (more hops = more bitter)- smells bitter, aromatic
    - New England IPA (formal) or Hazy IPA (informal)
        -This category can be broken down further to Conan Yeast (Less Hazy) and Manchester         Yeast (Super Hazy)
        -taste: juicy/fruity
        -regular ABV- 4.0 -7.0
    -Sour IPA-
        -taste: light, refreshing, crisp
        -low ABV- less than 4.0 ABV
    -Double IPA
        -look up taste on BJCP
        -higher ABV - 7.0-10.0
    -Triple IPA
        -lokk up taste on BJCP
        -Highest ABV - 10.0+
    -Other IPA
    -American Pale Ale -might want to group with IPA category.
    
    XXXXXXX
    
    Light IPA(called Session IPA)- less than 4.0 ABV
    Regular IPA- 4.0-7.0 ABV
    Double IPA- 7.0-10.0 ABV
    Triple IPA- 10.0+ ABV
    
SOURS- Categories
***HAS NO REAL “RULES”- if you lower the PH of a beer it is now considered a sour (brew beer, throw in acid, add fruit)***
***Two main categories are Berlinger and Gose, but fruited can be added***
    -Fruited Sours
        - most popular in RVA
        -taste: fruity
    -Berlinger Sours
        -taste: dry
    -Gose-
        -tatse: saltier/tart

STOUTS- Categories
    ***The higher the ABV, the sweeter the beer***
    -Porter (might not be worth adding- use judgement depending on beer data)
    -American Stout
        -taste: dry, crips, malty
        -below 8.0 ABV
    Imperial Stout
        -taste: intense, complex, fruity esters* (*sp???)
        -over 8.0 ABV and below 10.0 ABV
    Milk Stout
        -taste: creamy, thick, chewy- lactose is added directly to beer
        -can be any ABV
    Pastry Stout - “Birthday Cake Stout”
        -more of a dessert beer
        -taste: usually sweet
        -over 12.0 ABV

LAGER- Categories
    -American Light Lager (National Brand Bud Light- local breweries will have something to match     this style)
        -taste: crisp, dry finish, low bitterness, neutral palette
    -Czech* Lager (*sp-look up on BJCP)
        -taste: medium to low malt flavor
    -Kolsch Lager
        -taste: soft, rounded, crispy
    Dark European Lager
        -taste: moderate malt, bread
    Pilsner-
    Other- use for random beers


Brands they suggested we use for comparrison, they thought making this the first survey question might be wise
    -Belgium White- Allagash White, Blue Moon (compares to the fruited beers, Berliners, Belgium     Styles)
    -Anderson Valley- compares to Gose Sours
    -Stiegl Radler- compares to Berliners
    -Guinness- Pilsners, Stouts- has a very low ABV- lighter, lower ABV Stouts
    -Founders Breakfast Stout- higher ABV Stouts
    -Dog Fish Head 60 Min IPA- compares to East Coast IPAS
    -Sierra Nevada IPA- compares to West Coast IPAS


*** They also made note that women tend to like higher ABV beers since they are sweeter- Saisons, Fruity Tasting Beers- we might want to add a gender question because of this***

***Also suggested that we might want to add a Gluten-free option- which can direct to Meads/Ciders- most breweries have a gluten0free option- if there is some type of parameter with our data would be wise to include***
